# DL2

Deep Learning Learning Platform

## Frontend

Uses Angular & Angular material to host a frontend. Angular material provides an
out-of-the-box development experience considering UI design.

### Features

- Graph visualisation: Uses D3, a rather complex graph engine with embedded physics engine that handles the forces among nodes.
- WebASM integrated LSP: Uses Jedi & Pygments, Python language metatools to provide code autocompletions and syntax highlighting, embedded in JS using Pyodide.
- WebSocket based RTC: Uses WebSocket to provide a peer-to-peer connection in document editing context.
